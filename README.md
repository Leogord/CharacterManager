# CharacterManager
Final Project for QA

Why are we doing this?
As a long term World of Warcraft player i thought it would be nice to be able to store all your characters
in one place. This would stop me searching though the many realms i have characters on to find the one I'm after.

How I expected the challenge to go
I was quite worried about the project to begin with. It felt daunting and that i would never get it done.

What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
The project went a lot better then i was excepting. The only main issue i had was testing the DTO's but
got there in the end.

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
A lot of features could be added to this project. Adding a list of characters that you play the most. Or
added a login feature so multiple people could use the same app without messing with others data.
